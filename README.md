# Android Project 5 - *My BitFit App*

Submitted by: **Keyara Fleece**

**My BitFit App** is a health metrics app that allows users to track their meditation habits.

Time spent: **4** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [X] **At least one health metric is tracked (based on user input)**
  - Chosen metric(s): `meditation`
- [X] **There is a "create entry" UI that prompts users to make their daily entry (I opted to use a FLoating Action Button following Material Design patterns. 
Source: https://m2.material.io/components/buttons-floating-action-button#behavior)**
- [X] **New entries are saved in a database and then updated in the RecyclerView**
- [X] **On application restart, previously entered entries are preserved (i.e., are *persistent*)**
 
The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] **Create a UI for tracking averages and trends in metrics**
- [X] **Improve and customize the user interface through styling and coloring**
- [X] **Implement orientation responsivity**
- [ ] **Add a daily photo feature**

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [X] I changed my app launcher icon to my own app logo :)
